Over the past few decades computing systems have only grown in complexity. Rea‐
soning about how software behaves has created multiple business categories, all
of them trying solve the challenges of gaining insight into complex systems. One
approach to get this visibility is to analyze the logs of data generated by all
applica‐ tions running in a computing system. Logs are a great source of
information. They can give you precise data about how an application is
behaving. However, they con‐ strain you because you get only the information
that the engineers who built the application exposed in those logs.
